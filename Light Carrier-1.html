<h3>
    UCSC Nessie class light carrier:
<h3>
    <p>
        The Heart of many fleets, this carrier design allows for reliable deployment and recovery of fighter
        craft, even when under fire, with its modular radiator-engine stilt design, the ship can “tuck in”,
        reducing its overall cross section whilst in battle. Despite being a carrier it is also not helpless
        when caught in direct capital ship to capital ship combat, largely due to the presence of its heavy 
        coilguns, normally employed as point defense.
