<h3>
    Eridani Combined Coalition:
<h3>
<h4>
    The Eridani Combined Coalition(ECC) is the military alliance between all planets contained within the Eridani
    system. It being formed in response to the creation of the UCSC during the Centauri systems war of independence,
    though officially never entering that conflict. The weapon technolgies employed by the Coalition varies, though 
    highly differs from their adversaries in that the use of novel forms of weaponry, such as smart projectile weapons, 
    to weaponized gravity and jump gates are common, largely due to the ECC never signing any treaties regarding the 
    weaponization of the later two, as a consiquence of never being officially part of the Centauri war of independence.
